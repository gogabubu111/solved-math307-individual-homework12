<em>A </em>=

1 −<em>i</em>

by finding the matrix <em>B </em>such that <em>AB </em>= <em>I </em>and then double check <em>BA </em>= <em>I</em>.

find the solution to <em>Ax </em>= <em>b </em>using the following three different approaches. You should reach to the same answers for all approaches.

<ul>

 <li>Expand the linear equation system into two equations with two unknowns and then solve for <em>x </em>using elimination, substitution (what you learned in algebra class).</li>

 <li>Find <em>x </em>directly by using the fact that <em>A </em>applied one a vector is to rotate the vector for 45 degree. Think about how to reserve the transformation.</li>

 <li>Prove <em>A </em>is an orthogonal matrix first and use the fact to find the inverse of <em>A</em>, and then find <em>x </em>by calculating <em>A</em><sup>−1</sup><em>x</em>.</li>
